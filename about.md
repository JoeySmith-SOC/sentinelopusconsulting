description: About Joey — IAM × OT security specialist.
---

I’m an Identity & Access Management specialist who treats security like a leadership problem: if the outcome isn’t right, I own it until it is. I’ve supported and engineered IAM in live enterprise environments—authentication policies, SSO and provisioning stability, and automation so access is fast, auditable, and safe. I collaborate with product engineering and infrastructure teams, write the technical notes others actually use, and bring the same “own the mission” mindset to OT/electrical work, where security and safety must coexist.
