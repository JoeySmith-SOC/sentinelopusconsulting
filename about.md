# About Me

## Identity Engineer. Automator. Builder.  
## A self-made operator bridging cybersecurity, identity, and infrastructure.

I’m **Joseph “Joey” Smith** — an Identity & Access Management Engineer, Zero Trust practitioner, and automation-focused builder who prefers creating opportunities instead of waiting for them.

I’m not the “fluff” kind of engineer. I’m the type who digs in, learns the hard things, and builds systems that actually work at scale. I take what I do very seriously — if I touch something, it gets better, cleaner, faster, and more secure. No excuses. No shortcuts.

This site is where I publish my work, document my engineering process, and build my path forward — one project at a time.

# My Mission

To engineer secure, reliable, and automated identity infrastructure that removes friction, eliminates chaos, and strengthens the systems people depend on — whether it’s cloud, Zero Trust, or the bridge into operational technology.

Security doesn’t need to be complicated.  
It needs to be **engineered**.

# What I Do

I specialize in the intersection of **Identity**, **Zero Trust**, and **Automation**:

### **Identity & Access Management (Primary Lane)**
- Okta Workforce Identity  
- SAML/OIDC Federation  
- SCIM & Lifecycle Automation  
- Access Governance & Policy Design  
- Strong Authentication Architectures  

### **Zero Trust & Cloud Security**
- Cloudflare Zero Trust  
- Device Posture / mTLS  
- Least-Privilege Network Design  
- Certificate-Based Access  
- Identity-aware Routing  

### **Infrastructure & Automation**
- Linux engineering & shell scripting  
- Ansible + Terraform  
- Automated security baselines  
- Version-controlled environments  
- Operator-grade system hardening  

### **IT → OT Security Integration**
- SCADA/ICS segmentation  
- PLC/HMI hardening  
- Secure remote access  
- ICS/OT visibility & safety alignment

# My Path (So Far)

I didn’t come from a traditional “cybersecurity career launchpad.”  
I came from grinding, self-teaching, troubleshooting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning again.

Here’s the truth: I got tired of waiting for someone else to open the door — so I started building my own.

### **Phase 1 — The Technician**  
Learning the fundamentals: Linux, networking, security, and how real systems behave outside the textbook.

### **Phase 2 — The Identity Shift**  
Discovering IAM and realizing it’s the backbone of every modern environment — the thing everyone depends on yet very few truly understand.

### **Phase 3 — Automation & Zero Trust**  
Taking everything I learned and making it cleaner, faster, automated, and more resilient.

### **Phase 4 — IT meets OT**  
Studying electrical systems and operational technology to bridge the gap between cyber and the field.

### **Phase 5 — The Freelancer**  
Times changed. Opportunities weren’t given. So I decided to create them — through engineering, projects, and extreme accountability.

I’m still moving. I’m still learning. And I’m not stopping.

# How I Work With Clients

- **Transparency**  
  You will always know what I’m doing, why I’m doing it, and how it impacts your environment.

- **Security without friction**  
  I design systems that help users, not fight them.

- **Precision & documentation**  
  Engineers come and go — good documentation is forever.

If you want someone who does it right the first time, I’m your guy.
