description: About Joey — IAM × OT security specialist.
---

I’m an Identity & Access Management specialist who treats security like a leadership problem: if the outcome isn’t right, I own it until it is. I’ve supported and engineered IAM in live enterprise environments—standing up authentication policies, stabilizing SSO and provisioning, and pushing automation so access is fast, auditable, and safe.

I bridge cyber and the electrical/OT world. That means applying Zero Trust, segmentation, and monitoring where safety and uptime matter most. My north star is extreme accountability. There are no bad teams—only leaders who refuse to lead. If we work together, expect candid assessments, disciplined execution, and outcomes we can measure.
