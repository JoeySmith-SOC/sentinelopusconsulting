Welcome to the Sentinel Opus blog — the place where I break down the real engineering behind
**Identity**, **Zero Trust**, and **Operational Technology security**.

There are plenty of marketing blogs out there telling companies what “best practices” *should* look like.
This isn’t that.

Here, I focus on the *engineering* that actually makes organizations safer, faster, and more resilient:

### ** Identity Done Right (Okta, AD, Lifecycle, Federation)**  
Why so many companies misconfigure IAM, how identity breaks in the real world, and what a clean,
automated, secure setup actually looks like.

### **Zero Trust Without the Buzzwords**  
Zero Trust isn’t a product — it’s an approach. I write about Cloudflare Zero Trust, policy design,
device posture, certificate-based systems, and how to build secure access without slowing teams down.

### **The Bridge Between IT & OT**  
I combine cybersecurity with field experience. Expect posts about SCADA/ICS security, segmentation,
PLC/HMI hardening, electrical safety, and why modern OT networks require identity and automation.

If you work in IAM, cloud, or industrial environments — or you just like seeing security explained
with clarity instead of fluff — you’ll feel right at home here.
