### Sentinel Opus Consulting — Terms of Service

This site and the work offered are operated by a solo consultant. Engagements are delivered under a statement of work or consulting agreement that will govern scope, deliverables, and payment terms.

By using this site or contacting me, you agree:

- This is not legal advice; all content is informational.
- You are responsible for evaluating whether any guidance fits your environment.
- Availability is limited; no guarantee of engagement until a written agreement is signed.

### Data and communications

- Form submissions and emails are used only to respond to your inquiry and discuss potential work.
- I do not sell or share your contact information.
- If you ask to stop receiving communication, I will delete your information from my inbox and form system logs, except where retention is required by law or to enforce agreements.

### Security

- I take reasonable measures to protect correspondence, but you should avoid sending secrets or credentials until a secure channel and scope are established.
- Project artifacts, diagrams, and code are shared only under engagement terms and stored in client-approved systems.

### Changes

These terms may be updated periodically; material changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
