### Sentinel Opus Consulting — Privacy Policy

This site is run by a solo consultant. I collect only the information needed to respond to your requests and deliver consulting work.

### What I collect
- Contact form submissions (name, email, company, message) and direct emails.
- Basic site analytics if enabled (high-level traffic only; no invasive tracking).

### How it is used
- To reply to your inquiry and discuss potential work.
- To schedule, scope, and deliver consulting engagements.
- To send occasional follow-ups about active work (no newsletters by default).

### How it is stored
- Form submissions and emails are stored in email inboxes and the form provider (e.g., Formspree or Netlify Forms).
- Project deliverables are stored in client-approved repositories and shared drives.

### Sharing
- I do not sell or share your personal information.
- Data may be shared with subprocessors strictly for communication and storage (email, form provider), under their standard security controls.

### Retention
- Contact inquiries are kept while we’re in conversation and deleted upon request or after they are no longer needed to support a client relationship.
- Project records required for contractual or legal purposes may be retained as specified in the engagement agreement.

### Your choices
- You can request deletion of your contact information at any time.
- Avoid sending secrets, credentials, or regulated data through the form; a secure channel will be set up during an engagement.
