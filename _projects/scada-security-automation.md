**Problem:** Industrial networks often lack segmentation, visibility, and automation.  
**Solution:** Built a lab simulating OT/ICS infrastructure with VLAN segmentation, RBAC, Snort IDS, and Ansible automation.  
**Outcome:** Demonstrated “alert-to-action” response workflows and dashboards showing live traffic baselines.
