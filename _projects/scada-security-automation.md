**Problem:** OT networks often lack segmentation, monitoring, and automated response.  
**Solution:** Built a lab with VLANs, firewall rules, RBAC, Snort alerts, and Python/Ansible workflows to enforce policy.  
**Outcome:** Demonstrated alert-to-action automation; dashboards visualizing traffic baselines and anomalies.
