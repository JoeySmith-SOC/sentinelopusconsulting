## Problem / Context
IoT growth has expanded attack surfaces in residential and commercial electrical networks, with little visibility or segmentation.

## Approach / Architecture
Segmented IoT networks with MQTT + VLAN isolation, integrated Syslog and Grafana for event visibility, and added SIEM hooks for alerts.

## Outcome / Impact
Created a repeatable, safety-first blueprint for connected electrical and smart home systems with monitored gateways and remote access patterns.
