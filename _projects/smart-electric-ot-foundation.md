**Problem:** IoT growth has expanded attack surfaces in residential and commercial electrical networks.  
**Solution:** Segmented IoT networks with MQTT + VLAN isolation, integrated Syslog and Grafana for event visibility.  
**Outcome:** Created a repeatable, safety-first blueprint for connected electrical and smart home systems.
