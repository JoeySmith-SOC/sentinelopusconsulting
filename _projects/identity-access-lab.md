## Problem / Context
Managing lifecycle events across hybrid identity systems causes inconsistent access, stale accounts, and audit gaps.

## Approach / Architecture
Developed a simulated enterprise IAM lab with Okta, AD, and SAML integration—automating joiner/mover/leaver flows with PowerShell and GitHub-backed policies.

## Outcome / Impact
Demonstrated a secure, auditable identity environment with full federation and policy automation that mirrors real-world conditions.
