**Problem:** Managing lifecycle events across hybrid identity systems causes inconsistent access and stale accounts.  
**Solution:** Developed a simulated enterprise IAM lab with Okta, AD, and SAML integration—automating joiner/mover/leaver flows.  
**Outcome:** Demonstrated a secure, auditable identity environment with full federation and policy automation.
